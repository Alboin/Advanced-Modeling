To interpolate between to threshold values, press "A" when the rendering-window is active. You will then be asked in the console to enter a starting and ending threshold and also the number of frames to interpolate over.

The threshold can be manually increased/decreased with the up/down arrows on the keyboard.

The threshold step-size can be increased/decreased with the left/right arrows on the keyboard.

The spacebar can be used to toggle between triangle/line/point-rendering.

To swith between using BRDF or simple shading, press Enter.
When BRDF is active, W/E can be used to decrease/increase the fresenel constant and S/D to swith to more specular/diffuse reflection maps.
